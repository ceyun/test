Jenkins setup
After installing Docker, download the latest stable Jenkins image by running:

docker image pull jenkins/jenkins:lts

Run the container by attaching the volume and assigning the targeted port.
In this example, we'll also run it in detached mode.
Here is the command to run your Docker container:

docker container run -d \
    -p [YOUR PORT]:8080 \
    -v [YOUR VOLUME]:/var/jenkins_home \
    --name jenkins-local \
    jenkins/jenkins:lts

Ex;
And now, weâ€™re ready to take a look at an example of how you could run this command:

docker container run -d -p 8082:8080 \
    -v jenkinsvol1:/var/jenkins_home \
    --name jenkins-local \
    jenkins/jenkins:lts

As a part of the Jenkins setup, we need to view the password inside the container instance.
In order to do this, we need to use the CONTAINER ID (or the name) and run docker exec.
Here is the full command:

docker container exec \
    [CONTAINER ID or NAME] \
    sh -c "cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword"
